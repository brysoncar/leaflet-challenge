Earthquake Visualization with Leaflet
This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps, and D3.js, a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.

Overview
This project creates an interactive map displaying earthquake data from the past 7 days. Each earthquake is represented by a circular marker on the map. The size of the marker corresponds to the earthquake magnitude, and the color represents the depth of the earthquake. Additionally, a legend is provided to help users interpret the colors and sizes of the markers.

Features
Interactive Map: Users can explore earthquake data by zooming in/out and panning across different regions.
Marker Visualization: Each earthquake is represented by a circular marker on the map. The size of the marker corresponds to the earthquake magnitude, while the color indicates the depth of the earthquake.
Legend: A legend is provided to help users interpret the colors and sizes of the markers.
How to Use
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The map will be displayed along with earthquake markers.
Interact with the map by zooming in/out and panning across different areas.
Hover over a marker to view additional information about the earthquake, such as location, magnitude, and depth.
Use the legend provided on the map to interpret the colors and sizes of the markers.
